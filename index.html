   <section id="about">
      <p>Hello! My name is Poorvi. I'm a proud mom of two daughters‚Äî11 and 7 years old. I have worked in accounting
         for over 10 years and currently work at RWWA as a Finance Officer. I love dancing, Bollywood music, cooking,
         and ginger tea on rainy days ‚òîüçµ. I'm now learning coding and excited for this new journey!I have over 10 years
         of experience in accounting, during which I have gained proficiency in a variety of
         systems including Oracle-based platforms, TechnologyOne, Pronto, MYOB, and Parklane. I am passionate
         about accounting because it constantly presents new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge
         and skills.
         Currently, I work at RWWA (Racing and Wagering Western Australia), a racing organization, where I serve
         as a Finance Officer. In this role, I manage the racebooks for three different entities and ensure
         timely payments to participants. I truly enjoy being part of the RWWA team and find great satisfaction
         in the work I do.
